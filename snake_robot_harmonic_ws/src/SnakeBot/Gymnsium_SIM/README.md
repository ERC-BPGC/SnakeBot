Snake Robot Simulation Guide(Chatgpt for  simplification )

This is a guide for a Python program that makes a pretend snake robot move on your computer. It’s like a little game where the snake wiggles to move forward, and we see how good it is at moving. Let’s break it into tiny, easy bits!



What’s This Thing Do?

Imagine a toy snake made of blocks that can bend. This program:





Makes the snake wiggle like a real snake using wavy moves.



Runs little 10-second tests to see how far it goes.



Gives it points for moving forward fast.



Shows you pictures (graphs) of how well it did.

You can watch it wiggle in a window on your screen!



The Big Pieces

The program has 4 main parts—like ingredients in a recipe:





Tools (Imports): Stuff the program needs to work.



Snake World (SnakeEnv): Where the snake lives and moves.



Score Pictures (plot_rewards): Draws graphs of the snake’s points.



Start Button (main): Runs everything.

Let’s look at each one super simply.



1. Tools (Imports)

These are like helpers the program borrows:





gymnasium: Makes the pretend world.



MujocoEnv: Helps the snake move like it’s real.



numpy: Does math for us.



time: Slows things down so we can see.



matplotlib: Draws pictures of the scores.



2. Snake World (SnakeEnv)

This is the snake’s home. It’s split into little jobs.

Job lyk1: Starting Up (init)





Sets up the snake’s world.



Makes a big window (1280x720) to watch it.



Says the snake has 14 bendy parts (7 up-down, 7 side-side).



Keeps track of 41 things about the snake (like where it is and how fast it’s going).

Job 2: Looking at the Snake (_get_obs)





Takes a quick peek at the snake.



Writes down 41 numbers—like its spot, tilt, speed, and how its parts are bent.

Job 3: Moving a Tiny Bit (step)





Makes the snake wiggle once.



Picks wavy moves (like “big wiggle, fast wiggle”) using random numbers.



Example wiggle: “Bend up a little, then down, fast!”



Moves the snake a tiny step.



Checks if 10 seconds are up—if yes, it’s done.



Gives points for going forward.

Job 4: Starting Over (reset_model)





Puts the snake back to the start.



Picks new random wiggles for the next try.

Job 5: Picking Wiggles (_set_random_parameters)





Chooses random stuff for the wiggles:





How big the wiggle is.



How fast it wiggles.



Where the wiggle starts.



It’s like saying, “Wiggle big and slow this time!”



3. Score Pictures (plot_rewards)





Draws 2 pictures:





One shows all the points from each 10-second test.



One shows points for every tiny move in the last test.



Saves them as total_rewards_plot.png and last_episode_rewards_plot.png.



4. Start Button (main)





Turns on the snake world.



Keeps it going:





Moves the snake tiny bits.



Counts points.



After 10 seconds, starts over with new wiggles.



Prints stuff like “Episode 1: 50 points!”



When you stop it (close the window), it shows the pictures.



How It Works, Step by Step





Start: The program loads the snake and opens a window.



Wiggle: The snake moves with random wiggles for 10 seconds.



Score: It gets points for going forward.



Repeat: Starts over with new wiggles.



Finish: You close it, and it shows score pictures.



Easy Example

Think of the snake like a toy car with bendy parts:





You push “start,” and it wiggles forward.



If it goes far, it gets lots of points!



Every 10 seconds, you try a new wiggle to see if it’s better.



How to Play With It





Get Ready: Make sure you have the tools (like gymnasium) on your computer.



Find the Snake: Tell the program where the snake’s file is.



Run It: Start the program—watch the snake wiggle!



Stop It: Close the window when you’re done.



See Scores: Look at the pictures it saves.
